# Configuring the Vault EKM Provider

Configuration is stored in a `config.json` file in the installation folder. This
defaults to `C:\Program Files\HashiCorp\Transit Vault EKM Provider\`.

-> **Note:** If the Vault EKM Provider has already been installed, the Microsoft
    SQL Server service needs to be restarted for configuration changes to take
    effect.

The following options are supported:

- `vaultApiBaseUrl` `(string: required)` - Address of Vault server, e.g.
    `https://vault.example.com:8200`
- `enableTrace` `(bool: false)` - Enable trace logging. Logs are viewable from
    the event viewer. See [troubleshooting](/docs/platform/mssql/troubleshooting)
    for further details.
- `namespace` `(string: "")` - Set the Vault namespace to use. Applies to both
    AppRole and Transit.
- `appRoleMountPath` `(string: "approle")` - Use this to specify the path to the
    AppRole auth mount if it was set to a non-default path.
- `transitMountPath` `(string: "transit")` - Use this to specify the path to the
    Transit mount if it was set to a non-default path.
